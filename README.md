# TetrisX2
In our game of Tetris, we design the game as a two player game. The purpose remains the same as the single-player version: to strategically place falling tetromino blocks to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps. However, in our version the goal involves competing against another player to outlast them or force them to lose by filling their game board to the top with blocks. The game ends when one player reaches the top of their board. The winner is the player who survives the longest.
# Files
To create the game we have the html file which makes the body of the website. There is the styles.css file which has the has the colors use, format of the boards, the start and game over screen, and the blocks for the website. The last file is the JavaScript file, which has all the gameâ€™s logic to play the game. 
There is the deploy.sh that allows the website to be deploy on the browser if there is edits in the source files we refreash the screen to see the new edits.
